# Project 1: Kaggle Competition: IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection
A Kaggle competition that focuses on identify the fraud transaction given features like transaction amount, time, devices, etc... 

* Conducted exploratory data visualization to view behaviors of half a million transactions by seaborn and plt in python
* Implemented feature engineering to create 90+ new features based on the original dataset to boost the efficiency of machine learning models
* Developed four different models including XGboost and Lightgbm and Increased accuracy by 5% by Bayesian optimization
* Communicated with the team effectively as a leader and achieved ranking top 23% among 6351 international groups

**Key techniques**: Numpy, Pandas, Plt, Seaborn, Plotly, Sklearn, Random Forest(Xgboost, Lightgbm)

# Project 2: VAST Challenge 2017
An interactive visual analytics system to discover the abnormal events which could be resaons why bird poplutaion decreased in a Wildlife Preserve. 

* Analyzed the given data and generated the hypotheses for the decreasing bird populations in the preserve
* Designed the effective combinations of different types of interactive plots with coordinated views to detect the abnormal patterns 
* Generated a detailed report and successfully matched all abnormal events given in the challenge review guide

**Key techniques**: Python, Javascript, Vega.js, D3.js 

# Project 3: Training Named Entity From Imperfect Anotation 
A framework that can increase the NLP model accuracy by eliminating the effect of mislabeled data
